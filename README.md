# How to Use

The most up to date version will be the python file with the greatest task number. Fictious tasks will be created after task 8 (what the TA assigns) so that we can keep proper version control

# Version Control Regulations

All of the group members can edit the pre existing code, make *sure* you comment your changes when changing the code
