~~Task 4~~
~~Task 5~~
~~Task 6~~
~~Task 7~~

Task 8:
* ~~MiniMax AI w/ Alpha Beta Pruning (Also gives recursion bonus points)~~ ~~There might be bugs...I'll add code that takes the scores and gets the immediate best option~~
* ~~Try to beat the AI on hard difficulty~~
* ~~Choice of AI Difficulty~~

Task 9:
* ~~Utilize classes to simplify code structure~~ - Done on buttons
* ~~Add more heuristics to improve the AI speed and increase depth~~
* ~~Main Menu screen that allows you to play, how to play, etc...~~
* ~~Function that creates clickable buttons~~
* ~~Fix positioning of penalty points and the queue~~

Task 10 (Optional):
* ~~Add sounds and music to the game that changes based upon the difficulty played~~ - Function is there, add more sounds if you want
* ~~Remove the text at the top of the game board~~ Completed in Task 9
* Improve weighting system structure to be dynamic (OPTIONAL)
* Add the destroyed pieces of AI and the player to the bottom of the game board (OPTIONAL)

# Bugs

Current Bugs:
* ~~If the AI is redeploying a pawn and kills one of yours on the last rank, it won't kill it and will just teleport to its desired redeploy location~~ Should be fixed

# How to Use

The most up to date version will be the python file with the greatest task number. Fictious tasks will be created after task 8 (what the TA assigns) so that we can keep proper version control

# Version Control Regulations

All of the group members can edit the pre existing code, make *sure* you comment your changes when changing the code
